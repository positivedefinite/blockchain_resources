## Introduction
* [10min video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZEHOlZY2To&t=3s) - Siraj Raval uploading compressed knowledge straight into your mind. There is much more where that came from! I strongly recommend watching all of Siraj's videos about blockchain.
* [Blockchain Handbook](https://1drv.ms/b/s!AmwjQg6aibIch_o30qjR1FgI1hJApQ) - A somewhat bulky (55 pages) but very easy to read blockchain primer overviewing the whole domain.
* [Technical introduction](https://medium.com/@preethikasireddy/how-does-ethereum-work-anyway-22d1df506369) - A great medium post taking you step-by-step through essential building blocks of blockchain.
* [New protocol layer](https://medium.com/@coriacetic/the-four-layers-of-the-blockchain-dc1376efa10f) - How blockchain fits into the landscape of existing internet protocols.
* [Non-tech introduction](https://medium.com/startup-grind/key-takeaways-from-best-ted-talks-real-world-use-of-blockchain-technology-cef55247b5a0) - Key takeaways from TED talks about blockchain.
* [What is decentralization?](https://www.nasdaq.com/article/what-does-decentralization-actually-mean-cm860065) - An non-technical article by NASDAQ.
* [History](https://medium.com/founder-playbook/67-blockchain-articles-whitepapers-that-shaped-crypto-into-what-it-is-today-c538facfceb9) - A goldmine of publications that shaped blockchain into what it is today. Mostly about Bitcoin.
## (non-tech) Insights
* [What is blockchain?](https://hbr.org/2016/05/the-impact-of-the-blockchain-goes-beyond-financial-services?referral=03759&cm_vc=rr_item_page.bottom) - Blockchains ensure integrity and trust between strangers. They make it difficult to cheat. The Internet of Everything needs a Ledger of Everything.
* [Truth about blockchain](https://hbr.org/2017/01/the-truth-about-blockchain) - Blockchain as a fundamental rather than a disruptive technology. After TCP/IP was created in 1972 many companeis created <i> localized networks </i>. The same is now happening with private blockchains. They will not stand the test of time, just as intranets didn't.
* [Key security](https://medium.com/@nickneuman/keysplit-private-key-security-for-cryptocurrency-owners-d1653ea9631d) - A great article about why security of rpivate keys and not scalability is the biggest obstackle for mass adoption of blockchain.
* [Zk-proofs](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-trustless-society-improve-our-privacy-mark-van-rijmenam/?trackingId=6stmHj6mgJfmd%2FXX5faKRA%3D%3D) - A non-technical explanation of importance of zero-knowledge proofs.
* [Why decentralization matters](https://medium.com/@cdixon/why-decentralization-matters-5e3f79f7638e) 
## Academic Sources about Blockchain
* [Blockchain whitepapers](https://medium.com/founder-playbook/67-blockchain-articles-whitepapers-that-shaped-crypto-into-what-it-is-today-c538facfceb9) - s

## Decentralized Machine Learning
* [Convergence of gradient descent](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.7063.pdf) - Consensus optimization problems in multi-agent networks arise in collaborative data mining. This paper describes relation of network topology, stepsize etc with properties of convergence for various parameters.
## Decentralized Game Theory
* [Decentralized Nash Equillibrium](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.4421.pdf) - Mean field (MF) games.
* [Researcher in game theory](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/search/searchresult.jsp?ranges=2013_2018_Year&searchWithin=%22Authors%22:.QT.Chih-Yu%20Wang.QT) - Many GT problems relating to blockchain, but not only.
## Algorithm Design

* [Cryptokitties Smart Contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x06012c8cf97bead5deae237070f9587f8e7a266d#code) - The silly but effective face of the ERC721 token for trading non-tangible goods. Cryptokitties is the most successful smart contract in history of blockchain.
## Tutorials
* [Blockchain in 200 lines](https://medium.com/@lhartikk/a-blockchain-in-200-lines-of-code-963cc1cc0e54) - Make your own blockchain!
* [DApps for beginners](https://dappsforbeginners.wordpress.com/) - A bit outdated library describing an Ethereum-based blockchain stack. Good starting point if you're developing in JavaScript.
